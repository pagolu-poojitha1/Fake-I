# Fake-I
 The deepfake video revolution is a growing threat to the credibility of digital media in terms of technological capabilities that need advanced detection techniques. Deepfake technology and cybersecurity relate closely due to the threats they pose. The usage of this technology can be misused for malicious purposes causing a pit full of various cybersecurity issues. To counter these threats and protect users from fraudulent content, this research proposes a system called â€˜Fake-I' that can be implemented by the business or the organization or a potential user who doesn't want to be a victim of fraudulent news developed using deepfakes. with a prediction accuracy of 97.86%, Fake-I is over-detected and has a training accuracy of 98.97%. This system comprises a deepfake learning mechanism that detects the synthetic media content using ensembled neural networks. Ensemble neural networks are created by combining Convolutional Neural Networks with Recurrent Neural Networks to train the model.
